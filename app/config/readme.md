# Config Folder

**Folder Description**: Here we will keep files with configurations which can make our widget behavior different. For example widget can be configured from outside (by URL parameters)

```
│─ article.config.ts              # Widget configuration on currently opened article
│─ customText.config.ts           # Custom text of widget i.e. translations
```
